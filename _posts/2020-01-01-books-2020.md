## Ring Shout
by P. Djèlí Clark

Finished on 2020/11/21

Andrew's Rating: ⭐️⭐️


This book has all the components I usually enjoy in a horror book: action, gore, descriptive story telling, interesting characters, scary villains, a hero's quest, a magical sword, etc.   But ultimately I struggled to enjoy it.

## When Darkness Loves Us
by Elizabeth Engstrom

Finished on 2020/10/25

Andrew's Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️


4.5/5 I think what makes a good horror novel is how much it sticks with you after you finish.   This book has two novellas about ordinary people who experience extraordinary tragedy.  I loved both of them.

## Dark Ways to Death
by Peter Saxon

Finished on 2020/08/17

Andrew's Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️


Grady Hendrix describes the Guardians as Scooby Doo with more orgies and i think that pretty much accurately describes it :) 


## All Systems Red (The Murderbot Diaries, #1)

## The Vampires of Finistere (The Guardians, #4)

## The Spirit
by Thomas  Page

Finished on 2020/07/26

Andrew's Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️


3.5 stars - the writing isn't the greatest, but I enjoyed the story nonetheless


## The Nickel Boys
by Colson Whitehead

Finished on 2020/07/08

Andrew's Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️


I enjoyed this book more than his previous book (The Underground Railroad).  He sticks to the theme of the mistreatment of black people in America (both from a systemic perspective and a just plain-old blatant racism perspective) and he writes a compelling narrative.   He conveys a brutality that you would see in a Tarantino movie.

For me, I would like to see a more Django Unchained or Shawshank Redemption-style ending where the oppressed gets revenge on their oppressor, but that's not really his jam.


## Paperbacks from Hell: The Twisted History of '70s and '80s Horror Fiction
by Grady Hendrix

Finished on 2020/07/02

Andrew's Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️


Loved this book!   it really piqued my interest in classic horror (i’d always loved the movies but hadn’t read too many horror novels written prior to 1990).   Grady hendrix does a great job breaking down the categories of novels,   the historical context that lead up to the sub genre, the authors, and cover artists.    Definitely going to check some of these books out


## Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python
by Joel Grus

Finished on 2020/06/30

Andrew's Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️


I've been reading this book off and on for over a year and have enjoyed it.   As the book's title implies you're basically building up a library of tools for data science from scratch in python.  As data science largely builds on statistics and linear algebra, the first part of the book mainly builds on those concepts.   My only complaint is that you build up a library of tools, but little time is spent on how to use them. 


## Midnight Riot (Peter Grant, #1)
by Ben Aaronovitch

Finished on 2020/06/28

Andrew's Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️


Was an original plot with some refreshing characters.   In a way it reminded me of a cross between the dresden files and hot fuzz.


## If It Bleeds

## Shadow Prey (Lucas Davenport #2)
by John Sandford

Finished on 2020/04/12

Andrew's Rating: ⭐️⭐️


I didn't really find Shadow Love particularly menacing and I thought the relationship between Lucas and Lily was a bit rushed.


## Plunge #1

## Blue World
by Robert R. McCammon

Finished on 2020/03/31

Andrew's Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️


<strong>Great collection of short stories</strong>

Three favorites stories are Makeup, Chico, and the titular novella Blue World.   I definitely snickered at the end of Chico.

## Building Microservices: Designing Fine-Grained Systems
by Sam Newman

Finished on 2020/01/27

Andrew's Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️


This book was released 5 years ago, and while some of the technologies for implementing microservices have changed (such as AWS Lambda and other serverless technologies), I still found this book a good "mama bear" (not too light and not too heavy) book on how to design and architect microservices.    I found the chapters on domain driven design and "breaking up the monolith" to be very relevant to work I do today.
