You obviously don't pay for Facebook, so how does it make its money? By selling ads. How does it
display relevant ads? By knowing everything about you both from information from within its walled
garden, and from information it collects in ad-networks. You will be happier I promise. Make sure
you get your friends' birthdays and emails before you leave.

### How does this work?

| "First Party Data"           | Your Interactions within Facebook | Data From Ad Networks |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------|
| - Online Video Games         | - Groups you're a member of       |                       |
| - Shows You Stream           | - Articles you like               |                       |
| - Websites you interact with | - Profiles you look at            |                       |
|                              | - Ads you hover over              |                       |
|                              | - What you post                   |                       |

## Delete your Instagram

Instagram is owned by FB and is filled with annoying "influencers". Their add
revenue [exceeds that of facebook][1] at this point.

## Delete Whats App

Delete your WhatsApp. WhatsApp is owned by FB and collects information from you. If you need to send
private, encrypted messages, use Signal instead (and give them some money).

## For Business, Use Facebook Pages, But Have a Real Website

If you are a business, have a real website. Cross-post from your FB and Instagram page to your
website. People who don't have FB or Instagram account don't have full access to your business page.
SEO is mostly snake oil, but you want search engines to find your business website first, not FB.
