## Reset Your Privacy Settings

Over the last few years, I have allowed more and more technology companies into my day-to-day life.
Initially, it was Google for mail and search, then it was social media, then it was IoT gadgets (
such as alexa or internet connected light bulbs or security cameras). Whereas 15 years ago, I maybe
had two or three devices hooked up to my router, now I have over 20. This trend doesn't seem to be
slowing down, and I recently heard the term "Everything as a Service" for the new business model
going forward.

With every new service or device I brought into my life, I abdicated some portion of my privacy to
these companies. Many of these companies use this data to drive advertising revenue (I spent 8 years
working as a technologist at an ad-tech company, so I know how the sausage is made). I've been
spending quite a bit of time over the last few months trying to wrangle back some semblance of
privacy and control over the data that is my own.

I'm going to write a series of articles going over specific services and how and why you should
disconnect from them (or at least use them smartly as to protect your privacy).

## Principles for Internet Privacy

My guiding principles for internet privacy are:

1. The aphorism "**If you don't pay for the product, you are the product**" is my touchstone. Generally
   you should be cognizant of how technology companies make money before you use their services.
2. For communication, **use encrypted services**, and assume any other form of communication is public.
3. **Assume all internet-connected devices with a microphone or camera can listen in on you**.
4. **Assume all internet-connected devices with a GPS can track your location and transmit to 3rd
   party.**
5. **Own your own data**. This isn't really a privacy issue exclusively, but sits at the nexus between
   privacy and security and business sense.
