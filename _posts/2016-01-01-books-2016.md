## Outliers: The Story of Success
by Malcolm Gladwell

Finished on 2016/02/01

The anecdotes were interesting for the most part, but the book's primary thesis (of success being a combination of innate abilities and the environment and culture that lets them thrive) is pretty obvious.

## How to Raise an Adult: Break Free of the Overparenting Trap and Prepare Your Kid for Success
by Julie Lythcott-Haims

Finished on 2016/01/20

Andrew's Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️


Loved this book and the advice it gives.  I would recommend it to anyone who has children young or old.  The basic theme of the book is not to over-parent.  She lays out the ground-work for why kids are over-parented, why they live a "check-listed" existence, and how to escape from it.
