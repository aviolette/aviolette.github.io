This was the first book I read where I read some of it on audible and some of it on the kindle.  Kindle-audible sync is awesome.   Kate Mulgrew's reading of this book was very entertaining.

<strong>alternative title: hunter / gatherers ftw!</strong>

A great overview of the human race's evolution.   Great insight on the effects of the agricultural and industrial revolutions on our species.   i did find his definition of religion to be a bit broad.

## Kill Decision
by Daniel Suarez

Finished on 2017/03/08

Andrew's Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️


This book had a lot of potential, and was an enjoyable read.  Unfortunately it suffered from under developed characters, too many action story cliches, and major plot holes (my drone can't stay charged more than an hour how do these things stay aloft so long?).  They also didn't really wrap it up nicely at the end.
