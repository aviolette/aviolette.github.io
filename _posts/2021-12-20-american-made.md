Here are some American products that I've really come to like:

* [Benchmade Knives](https://www.benchmade.com/) - pretty awesome EDC knives and SOCP daggers
* [Beyond](https://beyondclothing.com/) - Beyond makes activewear.  They have a line made in America (which is $$$) and a "cheaper" line made in Taiwan.  I have bought their American-made rain jacket and it's virtually impervious to water.  I also have their fleece hoodie made in Taiwan which is also great. 
* [White's Boots](https://whitesboots.com/) - I bought a pair of Steven's boots from them recently...they took 16 weeks to make.  They're great, but size-down if you order them.
* [Inside Line Equipment](https://ilequipment.com/) - I have a lot of their bags at this point, including their 24L duffel, the large porteur bag, and some other smaller items.  Great construction and durability
* [Quoddy](https://www.quoddy.com/) - Nothing has made me feel like an old-man more than my quoddy mocassins, but I frankly don't care.  They're super comfortable and durable.  When I get another pair, I'm going to spend a little extra and get the kind that can be resoled.
* [Outlier](https://outlier.nyc/) - I have a pair of their Slim Dungarees, and they are great (waist size runs a bit small though, but that's forced me to lose weight)
* [Imogene & Willie](https://imogeneandwillie.com/)
* [Etsy](https://etsy.com) - I've bought quite a bit of localish stuff for my house (bowls, dog dishes, plates, pots, etc.).  
* [Room and Board](https://www.roomandboard.com/) - Most of their furniture is made in America (there are some items made in Japan).  Their website displays where each item is made.  If you live in the Chicago area, they have an outlet in Oakbrook that has some pretty good deals (I have negotiated down on a set of chairs before; so it is possible)
* [Thomas Moser](https://www.thosmoser.com/) - Everything they make is top-notch, but they are most known for the continuous-arm chairs.
* Farmers' Markets and Craft Fairs.  If you want to support local producers, then look no further.  
* [Splendid](https://www.splendid.com) - Splendid used to make all their mens clothes in USA and Mexico.  I loved their t-shirts, but they have stopped carrying mens clothing, so ðŸ˜”
* [360 Cookware](https://www.360cookware.com/) - Cookware and Bakeware.  Made in Wisconsin.  I have one of their sauce pans and a roasting pan.  Both are super study and solidly built.
* [Lodge](https://www.lodgecastiron.com/) - Lodge pans are made in Tennessee (some of their accessories are made in Taiwan).  I'm a huge fan of Lodge and Cast-iron.
