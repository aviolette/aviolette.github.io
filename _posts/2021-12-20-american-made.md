Buying American is great, and has many benefits: 

1. Reducing fuel consumption chewed up by long supply chains.
2. Increasing our capacity to manufacture vital items here.
3. Supporting American craftsmanship
4. Reducing overall consumption (it's expensive to buy American goods, and you "buy once, cry once", generally)

Here are some American products that I've really come to like:

* [Benchmade Knives](https://www.benchmade.com/) - pretty awesome EDC knives and SOCP daggers
* [White's Boots](https://whitesboots.com/)
* [Inside Line Equipment](https://ilequipment.com/) - I have a lot of their bags at this point, including their 24L duffel, the large porteur bag, and some other smaller items.  Great construction and durability
* [Quoddy](https://www.quoddy.com/) - Nothing has made me feel like an old-man more than my quoddy mocassins, but I frankly don't care.  They're super comfortable and durable.  When I get another pair, I'm going to spend a little extra and get the kind that can be resoled.
* [Outlier](https://outlier.nyc/) - I have a pair of their Slim Dungarees, and they are great (waist size runs a bit small though, but that's forced me to lose weight)
* [Imogene & Willie](https://imogeneandwillie.com/)
* [Etsy](https://etsy.com) - I've bought quite a bit of localish stuff for my house (bowls, dog dishes, plates, pots, etc.).  Pay attention where the artist is located and whether the item is handmade.
* [Room and Board](https://www.roomandboard.com/) - Most of their furniture is made in America (there are some items made in Japan).  Their website displays where each item is made.  If you live in the Chicago area, they have an outlet in Oakbrook that has some pretty good deals (I have negotiated down on a set of chairs before so it is possible)
* [Thomas Moser](https://www.thosmoser.com/) - Everything they make is top-notch, but they are most known for the continuous-arm chairs.
* Farmers' Markets and Craft Fairs.  If you want to support local producers, then look no further.  
* [Splendid](https://www.splendid.com) - Splendid used to make all their mens clothes in USA and Mexico.  I loved their t-shirts, but they have stopped carrying mens clothing, so ðŸ˜”
* [360 Cookware](https://www.360cookware.com/) - Cookware and Bakeware.  Made in Wisconsin.  I have one of their sauce pans and a roasting pan.  Both are super study and solidly built.
* [Lodge](https://www.lodgecastiron.com/) - Lodge pans are made in Tennessee (some of their accessories are made in Taiwan).  I'm a huge fan of Lodge and Cast-iron.
