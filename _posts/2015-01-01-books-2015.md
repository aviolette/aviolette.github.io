Man, after reading lots of crappy young adult fantasy fiction lately, this restored my faith in the genre.  


## The American Plate: A Culinary History in 100 Bites
by Libby H. O'Connell

Finished on 2015/09/19

Andrew's Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️


I enjoyed this book, particularly the chapters covering American food through the first part of the twentieth century, but as it went on the chapters became a little less detailed and a little more preachy.  For instance, there is a chapter that somehow links Quiche to feminism.  There is a chapter on salsa that complains about the evil Tea Party.  The chapter on Wonder Bread talks about how Archie Bunker WOULD PROBABLY eat it and, and it is loved by conservatives.  Come on.


## The Girl on the Train
by Paula Hawkins

My main take-away from this novel is that, somewhere, they sell Gin & Tonic in a can.  All the characters in this novel are varying degrees of messed-up.  It's really hard to connect with any of them.  That said, I think the author does a fine job using false/incomplete first-person narratives to weave a cohesive story.
