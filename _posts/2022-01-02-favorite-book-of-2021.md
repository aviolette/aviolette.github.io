![Blackwater Saga](/images/blackwater.jpeg)

The Blackwater saga[^1] is my favorite book of 2021.  It was written by Michael McDowell, who is best known for writing the screenplays for *The Nightmare Before Christmas* and *Beetlejuice*.

Blackwater tells the of a shape-shifting river monster that becomes the matriarch of a wealthy southern family.  I feel like I need to say no more. ðŸ‘ˆ

[^1]: It's actually a collection of six books that were written in the early 80s, but you can get the omnibus edition which has all books combined into one.
