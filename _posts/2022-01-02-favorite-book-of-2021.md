![Blackwater Saga](/images/blackwater.jpeg)

The Blackwater saga[^1] is my favorite book of 2021.  It was written by Michael McDowell in the 1980s, who is best known for writing the screenplays for *The Nightmare Before Christmas* and *Beetlejuice*.

Blackwater tells the tale of a shape-shifting river monster that becomes the matriarch of a wealthy southern family.  The book is 80% epic, southern-gothic, soap opera combined with 20% Lovecraftian horror.   Elinore is one of my favorite characters of all time.  Even when she's doing the most horrible things, you can't help but think what a bad-ass she is.

[^1]: It's actually a collection of six books that were written in the early 80s, but you can get the omnibus edition which has all books combined into one.
