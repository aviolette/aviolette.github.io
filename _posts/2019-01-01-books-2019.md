## Dark Matter
by Blake Crouch

I read this book in two sittings.   Very intense.  His explanations of quantum effects were very straightforward (as much as the topic can be) and accessible.

This could be a 4 star but lacked editing and included Omaha from Sandstorm, who is the JarJar Binks of the James Rollins universe

## Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems
by Martin Kleppmann

Finished on 2019/12/22

Andrew's Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️


This is a great comprehensive overview of the state of data-engineering: from the early days to the present and with an overview of where the technologies are likely to converge.  The topic itself is kind of dry and it's hard to read it from cover to cover (I did it over the course of 10 months :D).   Highly recommend.

I consider myself a pretty diehard mccammon fan, but i had a really hard time getting through this book. 

in general i just thought it was too long and the dialogue was not that interesting.

## Pencil Me in: The Business Drawing Book for People Who Can't Draw
by Christina Wodtke

Finished on 2019/07/06

Andrew's Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️


I really enjoyed this book and found it slightly more useful than the _The Sketchnote Handbook  The Illustrated Guide to Visual Note Taking_ by Mike Rohde.  The beginning of the book has good examples and exercises for the building blocks of visual notes.   The latter half of the book describes how to apply those building blocks in various business contrxts (whiteboarding, mindmapping, wireframes, etc).   I found that very useful and will continue to practice these techniques.

by James Rollins

Finished on 2019/05/01

Andrew's Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️



While not as ridiculous as the previous book in the series (which had good natured cannibals), this one was almost on par.  i thought the whole cabal was a bit over the top as well as the entire plot with the Russians.  Even though the plot is ridiculous i had a hard time putting it down.


## Revival
by Stephen King

Finished on 2019/04/26

Andrew's Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️


the ending of this book was a great tribute to lovecraft and his notion that there is a world beyond ours that bears incomprehensible evil.   it took a long time to get to the money shot, however.   although he seems to connect all the characters at the end, the book could have been faster paced.  that said, days after reading this book i still think about that ending....


Also,   i listened to some of this book on audible.  The man narrating had such a down-east yankee drawl, i listened on 1.25x speed.

3 hot asian female assassins and two doctor evils plus an island full of cannibals (who were the good guys).  The plot was convoluted and quite unbelievable but I still enjoyed it

A fun short story.   You kind of have to know all the characters in the Corbett series to understand it.

i read this book in 10 minutes.   more of an introductory article than a book.  i learned nothing new but with 30 years of experience on linux im probably not the target audience.    Julia Evans zines are way better imho for the same material.

## Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow
by Yuval Noah Harari

Finished on 2019/01/22

Andrew's Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️


There’s a scene in The Matrix where Morpheus dramatically explains to Neo that the AI overlords of the future have reduced human existence to a Duracell battery.  Harari’s thesis is similar, but he reduces human behavior to algorithms that are ever evolving.   Furthermore, the conclusion that he comes to at the end is that eventually homo sapiens will evolve into an inter-connected borg like existence where the data that these algorithms generate is all-important.  The god in this scenario is The Internet of All Things and the religion is termed 'Dataism'.

He spends a lot of time working up to this conclusion, specifically focusing on how humanism had replaced theistic religions, and the implications that has had on how we treat the world around us.  He spends a good time talking about how theistic religions have allowed us to mistreat other animals.

He delves into philosophy of mind type stuff, such as some of the research around split-brain experiments.  The conclusion that he reaches is that of reductionism and that there is no soul, no self, and no free will.  There are only biochemical reactions in the brain (aka our human algorithms).  In college I read _Gödel, Escher, Bach  An Eternal Golden Braid_ by Douglas R. Hofstadter which I thought covered this topic more completely.

Towards the last half of the book, he tries to weave his predictions for the future - that technology will become our master, rather than the other way around.    We have given up a lot of our privacy and frankly our individuality, by letting big tech companies collect an ever increasing stream of data from us.  They then use this data to teach machines to know us better than ourselves (and eventually take over our jobs that give us meaning).  He gives lots of convincing examples.

I thought this was a very thought provoking read.  The only thing I really didn't like was that the first half of the book was a recap of Sapiens.   For instance, he talks a lot about how humans were at their best when we were hunter/gatherers.  He talks about religion/markets/governments as 'fictions'.  In Sapiens, he uses the term 'myths', but you get my drift.  I also thought there should have been more citations in the book, since that's how like to learn more.
