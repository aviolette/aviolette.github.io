<strong>Not my favorite of the series</strong>

This book was a fun read and had some of the colorful characters and action that I expect from RM.  However I didn’t enjoy the plot as much as the others in the series.  Also, didn’t really like how the ending didn’t wrap up cleanly.

## Wizard's First Rule (Sword of Truth, #1)
by Terry Goodkind

Finished on 2018/11/18

Andrew's Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️


I was somewhere in between a 3 and a 4 with this book so I rounded up.  Some of the world-building to me was a bit clunky.   For instance if it only takes a few days for these guys to figure out how to get across the boundary, why isn't this more of a regular thing?  It looks on a map like there's a sea, so why can't cross-boundary travel happen that way?

Aside from some of the stuff that made no sense, I thought the requisite fantasy stuff was all there.  A hero, a mysterious woman, a wizard, a bad guy bent on destruction, a quest, a dragon, etc.  It was different enough from stories like LOTR that it was still interesting.

## The Cruelest Month (Chief Inspector Armand Gamache, #3)

## The Lessons of History
by Will Durant

Finished on 2018/09/11

Andrew's Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️


This is a small book and was written in 1968.  Many things were interesting (such as how the authors describe the cycle of socialism and capitalism that has persisted throughout recorded history).  Many things were inaccurate, such as this statement "In the United States the lower birth rate of the Anglo-Saxons has lessened their economic and political power; and the higher birth rate of Roman Catholic families suggests that by the year 2000 the Roman Catholic Church will be the dominant force in national as well as in municipal or state governments. " 

All and all, I prefer more contemporary all-encompassing history books such as "Sapiens" by Yuval Noah Harari and "A Short History of Nearly Everything " by Bill Bryson.


## The Providence Rider (Matthew Corbett, #4)
by Robert R. McCammon

Finished on 2018/09/07

## Inferno (Robert Langdon, #4)
by Dan Brown

Finished on 2018/08/24

Andrew's Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️


Basically the same plot as Avengers:Infinity War but with less men in tights and more art history.   Just like Thanos, the Shade was the good guy but misunderstood


## Stinger
by Robert R. McCammon

Finished on 2018/08/12

Andrew's Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️


The whole book takes place over the period of 24 hours in one location (similar to Invasion of the Body Snatchers).  Most of the characters are 2 dimensional eighties clichés (which is not the case in many of his other books).  Some of the dialog is cringeworthy by today's standards (even maybe by 80s standards).  That said, it was still a good action/sci-fi novel and was a fun read.


## The Border
by Robert R. McCammon

Finished on 2018/07/14

Andrew's Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️


not my favorite robert mccammon novel by far.   it was entertaining but a bit all over the place.   i liked the ending even though some did not


## Speaks the Nightbird (Matthew Corbett, #1)

## CyberStorm (Cyberstorm, #1)
by Matthew Mather

Finished on 2018/07/06

nothing bordering on suspenseful happens until the last couple chapters.   bad character and story development

## The Outsider
by Stephen King

Finished on 2018/06/22

Andrew's Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️


was a really good and terrifying read.   as others have pointed out: this book has characters and references events from the bill hodges trilogy so probably best to read those first.


## Ancillary Justice (Imperial Radch #1)
by Ann Leckie

Finished on 2018/06/17

Andrew's Rating: ⭐️⭐️


this book is basically the plot of Kill Bill (a person seeking revenge, seeking a weapon with which to do it, with flashbacks to establish motive).   Unlike kill bill, the action sucks.    the book is mostly dialog, and existential reflections from the ancillary telling the story.   The use of “she” wouldnt bother me so much if the author would have spent any time describing the characters’ appearance.   ive heard this was done intentionally but i prefer more detail and character development in the stories i read


## Mister Slaughter (Matthew Corbett, #3)

## The Fifth Season (The Broken Earth, #1)
by N.K. Jemisin

Finished on 2018/05/27

Andrew's Rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️


the world and magic were unique and interesting.  nothing really happens until about half way through the book.  i found the characters to be a little boring and depressing, though.
