When it snows, I recommend a shovel.

1. Shovels cost $20 (I recommend buying American).  Snow-blowers 20X that.
2. Shovels are zero-emission and environmentally friendly.
3. Shovels don't have 2-cycle engines that wake up your neighbors at 4 in the morning.
4. Shovels require zero yearly maintenance.
5. Shoveling is good exercise.
